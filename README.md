### :dart: Description
Architectural materials play important role into the process of design. When it comes to new and innovative materials, the professional should know all the details about them. 

In order to find new materials available in the market, architects work with various production and suppling companies. By the time new materials and textures get into the research, architects/ interior designers need to have the knowledge about it.

<h2> Pain Points</h2>
First and most important factor for material selection as an architect and working in the field of designing it is always necessary to have knowledge about various materials and techniques available in the market. 

To gather information about vernacular materials and products for construction, designers usually go out in the market and do research on them.
Pain point in the entire process is to go on site and try these materials every time with having less knowledge about them will makes the process slow and tiring.

<h2> Goal of the Study</h2>
In order to do research about materials and how they will look on actual site, a product with a vision of textures and multiple options for finishing materials which looks real will help the designers to solve the problem of selections and making right decision in time. 

The product should have enough materials according to the real-world designs and actual materials properties with some effects in order to make the selection process easy.
